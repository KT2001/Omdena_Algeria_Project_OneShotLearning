# Omdena_Algeria_Project_OneShotLearning

This is an implementation of [Siamese Neural Network](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/siamese-neural-networks-for-one-shot-image), for one shot classification of [Plant Village dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/plantvillage), in this use case we will be using a samller dataset created manually for 'Tomato_yellow_curl_virus'.

This is just an experimental implementation of Siamese Neural Network for plant village dataset.

This notebook is heavily inspired by [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKispFFQ5GU&t=4333s), so feel free to check it out.
